#Pizza Sales Report

I'm thrilled to share one of my data analysis project that I worked on as part of my journey into the world of data analytics.📉

🍕 i had the opportunity to dive into the fascinating realm of pizza sales data 🍕📊. Using tools like Power BI, I learned how to extract, clean, and analyze data to drive meaningful insights. 📈 Here are some of the highlights of what I discovered Total Revenue: We calculated the total revenue, providing a comprehensive view of the business's financial performance.
Average Order Value: Analyzing this metric allowed us to understand customer spending patterns.
Total Pizzas Sold: We determined the total quantity of pizza sold, giving insights into product demand.
Total Orders: Tracking the number of unique orders revealed customer engagement.
Average Pizzas Per Sold: This metric helped us understand customer behaviour and performance.
📆 We also expected daily and monthly trends in total in total Orders, which provided actionable insights for improving delivery routes and regional sales strategies.

🍕 The project was a valuable learning experience, and I'm excited to continue developing my data analysis skills. I 'm learned to help businesses make data-driven decisions.
💡 If you'd like to connect or have any insights to share, I'd love to hear from you! Let's explore the endless possibilities of data together.
